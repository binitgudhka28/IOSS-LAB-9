StarUML is an open source software modeling tool that supports the UML (Unified Modeling Language) framework for system and software modeling. It is based on UML version 1.4, provides eleven different types  of  diagram  and it  accepts  UML  2.0  notation. 
It  actively  supports  the  MDA  (Model  Driven Architecture) approach by supporting the UML profile concept and allowing to generate code for multiple languagesWhen you start a new project, StarUML proposes which approach you wantto use: 4+1 (Krutchen), Rational, UML components (from Cheesman and Daniels book), default or empty.
Depending on the approach, profiles and/or frameworks may be included and loaded. If you don't follow a specific approach, the "empty" choice could be used.
Although a project can be managed as one file, it may be convenient to divide it into many units and manage them separately if many developers are working on it together.StarUML makes a clear conceptual distinction between models, views and diagrams. AModel is an element that contains information for a software model.
A View is a visual expression of the information contained in a model, and a Diagram is a collection of view elements that represent the user's specific design thoughts.
StarUML is build as a modular and open tool. It provides frameworks for extending the functionality of the tool. It is designed to allow access to all functions of the model/meta-model and tool through COM Automation, and it provides extension of menu and option items. Also, users can create their own approaches and frameworks according to their methodologies. The tool can also be integrated with any external tools
.StarUML supports the following diagram types
•Use Case Diagram•Class Diagram
•Sequence Diagram
•Collaboration Diagram
